# password-generator

A functional password generating application that creates a completely random password based on whether the user prefers lower or uppercase, numbers, and/or special characters. The user is prompted to specify which criteria they prefer and as long as their preferred amount of characters is between 8 and 128, the generator will create a unique password. If the user enters no criteria, they will not be able to use the generator.
